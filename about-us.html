<h1>About our US food assistance reference and sourcing</h1>
</header>
<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Mission and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Atlas exists to provide clear, policy-aware guidance on food assistance access and pantry operations in the United States. Our primary audiences are residents seeking help feeding their households and pantry teams working to improve service quality and reach. We recognize that navigating the intersection of federal programs, state rules, and local provider policies can be confusing and time-consuming. Our mission is to compile verified information, present it in plain language, and link directly to authoritative sources so you can make informed decisions quickly.</p>
<p>We do not advocate for specific policies or political positions. Instead, we document how the system works today, highlight common pain points, and offer practical checklists and comparisons. Whether you are a volunteer coordinator training new staff, a resident comparing SNAP and WIC, or a county agency looking for best-practice examples, you will find objective, source-forward content here.</p>
<p>This site is not a substitute for legal advice, and we are not a government agency. We are a reference resource. When we say "verify locally," we mean it: rules vary by state, county, and even by individual pantry. Our role is to give you the background knowledge and the right questions to ask, not to make eligibility determinations or provide case-specific guidance.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive overview of food assistance programs and access steps, <a href="/">return to the access guide homepage</a>. For answers to common questions about documents, privacy, and visit logistics, <a href="/faq">review the FAQ for visit expectations</a>. Both pages are designed to work together with this About section, forming a complete reference suite.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="content-section">
<h2>How we verify and update information</h2>
<p>Our editorial workflow prioritizes primary sources and widely cited references. We begin by consulting federal agency websites—particularly the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">USDA Food and Nutrition Service (fns.usda.gov)</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">CDC nutrition resources (cdc.gov)</a>—as well as state agency portals, peer-reviewed research, and reports from established nonprofit networks. When federal or state policy changes, we update affected pages and note the revision date.</p>
<p>Cross-checking is essential. A single source may be outdated or reflect only one state's rules. We compare information across multiple agencies, look for consensus in policy summaries, and flag areas where rules vary significantly. For example, SNAP income limits are federally set but states have options around deductions and categorical eligibility; we note those variations and link to state-specific resources.</p>
<p>Date-stamping and corrections are part of our transparency commitment. Each page includes a last-updated note (not always visible in the header, but tracked internally), and when we correct an error, we log it with a brief explanation and a link to the source that prompted the change. This practice ensures accountability and helps readers understand the evolution of policy and practice.</p>
<p>We also monitor major news outlets, academic publications, and nonprofit sector reports to identify emerging issues—such as changes in TEFAP commodity availability, new state waivers, or shifts in pantry best practices. Our goal is to reflect the current landscape accurately while acknowledging that food assistance policy is dynamic and sometimes contested.</p>

<h2>Editorial standards table</h2>
<p>The table below summarizes the core standards that guide our content creation and maintenance. These principles ensure that Civic Pantry Atlas remains a reliable, accessible, and practical resource.</p>

<caption>Standards used to keep guidance practical and verifiable.</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Standard</th>

</figure>
<p>Source-first means every factual claim is backed by a link to a government agency, academic institution, established nonprofit, or reputable news outlet. We do not rely on anonymous tips or unverified social media posts. When we cannot find a reliable source for a claim, we do not publish it.</p>
<p>Local variability is a constant theme because US food assistance is a patchwork of federal, state, and local rules. A pantry in California may operate very differently from one in Texas or New York. We remind readers to verify details with their local provider or county agency, and we provide links to directories and state portals to make that verification easier.</p>
<p>Plain language is both a stylistic and an ethical choice. Food insecurity affects people across education and literacy levels, and our content must be understandable to everyone. We define technical terms, use short sentences, and organize information with headings, lists, and tables. Accessibility extends to our HTML and CSS: we use semantic markup, ensure keyboard navigation works, and provide focus-visible styles so users can see where they are on the page.</p>
<p>These standards are not static. We review and refine them as we learn from user feedback, changes in web standards, and evolving best practices in public-interest publishing. Our commitment is to continuous improvement and transparency.</p>

<section id="contact" class="content-section">
<h2>Corrections and contact</h2>
<p>If you find an error, outdated information, or a broken link, please let us know. We take corrections seriously and aim to address them promptly. You can reach us by email at <a href="mailto:corrections@example.com">corrections@example.com</a>. Please include the page URL, a description of the issue, and a link to a reliable source if you have one.</p>
<p>We do not operate a web form for contact because we want to avoid requiring JavaScript and third-party services. Email is simple, accessible, and preserves your privacy. We do not share contact information with third parties, and we do not use it for marketing.</p>
<p>For general inquiries, partnership questions, or media requests, you can write to us at:</p>
<address>
Civic Pantry Atlas<br>
P.O. Box 12345<br>
Anytown, USA 00000
</address>
<p>We do not provide case-specific advice or eligibility determinations. For those questions, contact your local pantry, county social services office, or a legal aid organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corrections are logged with a date note and a source link so readers can see what changed and why.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transparency in corrections builds trust. When we update a page due to a reader report or a policy change, we note the date and the reason. This practice is standard in journalism and scientific publishing, and we apply it here because food assistance information has real consequences for people's lives.</p>
